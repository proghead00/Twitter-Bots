# Twitter-Bots
## Twitter bots made with Python and use Twitter API, which aid a Twitter account to gain new followers and fame. It auto-likes, auto-retweets, based on the hashtag(s) you enter and number of tweets you want to execute automation on, and automatically follows people back.

Firstly, you need to have access to Twitter API.

After you have access to API:
### Steps to use:

2. Install tweepy: <code> pip install tweepy </code>
2. Run the code: <code> python all_bots_in_one.py </code>
